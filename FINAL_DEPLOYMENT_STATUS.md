# üéâ FINAL DEPLOYMENT STATUS - Brain Link Tracker

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS**

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Problem You Experienced:
You couldn't see the new features and upgrades that bolt.new added to your project after deployment to Vercel.

### Why This Happened:
1. **Old Build Artifacts** - The repository contained pre-built static files in `src/static/` with OLD file hashes:
   - `index-P7845-yc.css` (187KB) ‚ùå OLD
   - `index-nrS3Px71.js` (1.1MB) ‚ùå OLD

2. **Vercel Serving Stale Content** - Vercel was likely serving these old committed static files instead of rebuilding from the updated source files.

3. **Source Files Were Updated** - bolt.new DID update all your frontend components (AdminPanel, Dashboard, Analytics, etc.) but they weren't being built into the production bundle.
