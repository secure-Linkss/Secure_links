# 🚀 Deployment Fix Complete - October 24, 2025

## 🔍 Issue Identified

**Root Cause:** Vercel was serving OLD pre-built static files from `src/static/` instead of rebuilding from source.

### What Was Wrong:
1. ✅ Frontend source files WERE updated by bolt.new
2. ✅ Backend APIs WERE updated and comprehensive
3. ❌ Old build artifacts in `src/static/` were committed to Git
4. ❌ Vercel's `api/index.py` was pointing to old static folder
5. ❌ New changes not visible because old build was being served

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Frontend Rebuild** ✅
- Installed all dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Built fresh production bundle with `npm run build`
- Generated new dist folder with updated components:
  - **dist/assets/index-BqaABabg.css** (193.59 KB)
  - **dist/assets/index-C9wa68dY.js** (1,168.19 KB)

### 2. **Removed Old Build Artifacts** ✅
- Deleted `src/static/` folder completely
- Old files had wrong hashes (index-P7845-yc.css, index-nrS3Px71.js)
- Prevents Vercel from serving stale content

### 3. **Database Schema Verified** ✅
All required tables present:
- ✅ users
- ✅ links  
- ✅ tracking_events
- ✅ campaigns
- ✅ notifications
- ✅ audit_logs
- ✅ security_threats
- ✅ support_tickets
- ✅ domains

### 4. **API Endpoints Verified** ✅
