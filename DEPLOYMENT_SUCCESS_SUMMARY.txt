📋 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

  ❌ ISSUE: Vercel was serving OLD pre-built static files
     - Old files in src/static/ (index-P7845-yc.css, index-nrS3Px71.js)
     - Prevented new features from appearing on frontend
     - bolt.new HAD updated source files, but they weren't being built

  ✅ SOLUTION: 
     - Removed old src/static/ folder completely
     - Forced Vercel to rebuild from source
